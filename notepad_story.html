            It all started when a boy stumbled upon a TikTok live stream. He was captivated by the girl on the screen, 
            laughing and engaging with her audience. After the live ended, he received a message from her: 
            "<strong>So bakit di ka nag CODM? Hahaha! 😂</strong>"
        </p>
        <p>
            That night, they began to chat. The girl shared that she lived in Taguig but didn’t disclose her exact address. 
            She was a first-year nursing student at OLFU in Valenzuela, having transferred from TIP where she initially pursued civil engineering. 
            They talked about her transportation options, which included jeep, walking, tricycle, train, and jeep again. 
            She mentioned how she had to wake up early for her morning classes. 🚌🚶‍♀️🚲🚆
        </p>
        <p>
            A day later, she messaged him again, asking for help with an interview project. The interview was confidential and 
            covered topics like living arrangements, pets, and family lifestyle. The girl was on camera while the boy stayed shyly off-screen. 
            During the interview, she asked him how many pets he had, and he mentioned:
            <strong>"I have a ball python 🐍, three dogs 🐶🐶🐶, an iguana 🦎, and some cats 🐱."</strong> 
            The girl jokingly replied, <strong>"Is your house a zoo? Where’s the lion? Or the tiger? 🦁🐯"</strong> 
            They both laughed during the call, feeling a special connection. 😂
        </p>
        <p>
            After the interview, she joked that someone asked if they were in a relationship, noting how well he responded to her questions during the live. 😄
        </p>
        <p>
            One day during her live stream, she mentioned one of her favorite stuffed toys, a shark named "JL" 🦈, which had the initials of the boy. 
            They laughed together, and the boy felt an unexpected joy as they connected through this playful moment. 🌟
        </p>
        <p>
            A week later, they talked again on Instagram. They were both busy with school, but every time he posted an Instagram story, 
            she mirrored it, like the moon 🌕 and the LRT train 🚆. One day, after viewing his story, she immediately replied, laughing about how they had the same story. 😂📱
        </p>
        <p>
            Their conversations faded for two months, but during her live streams, they still mentioned each other. 
            The boy became a moderator in her live sessions because the viewers loved their dynamic. 
            He would always watch her live broadcasts, commenting and engaging until one of her friends, who had known her since first year, created a group chat on Messenger. 💬
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, the girl sent him a link to join the group chat, welcoming him into the circle. 📨
        </p>
        <p>
            From there, they could chat more often in the group chat. The others in the group were friendly toward her and often teased her 
            about sharing a lot. They also played CODM together, but the boy didn’t tease her or join in the games because he had stopped playing. 🎮❌ 
            Instead, he preferred to keep his contributions to the group limited, only sharing what they asked him. 
            As the group talked about their lifestyles and shared their thoughts, the boy actively messaged the group whenever he saw her participating. 📚💻
        </p>
        <p>
            They mainly exchanged messages on Instagram during special occasions, such as <strong>happy birthdays 🎂 and Happy New Year 🎉. </strong>
            They would share brief greetings and express gratitude for having met, even if only online. 🙏💌
        </p>
        <p>
            Months went by without contact. The girl stopped posting and doing live streams, leaving the boy uncertain. 😔 
            But when she returned to live streaming months later, he felt conflicted. He knew she was nearing graduation 🎓 and wasn't looking for a relationship. 
            He, too, was focused on his studies 📖, but deep down, he liked her. ❤️
        </p>
        <p>
            When she started doing live streams again, the boy only messaged her about how she was doing and how her studies were going. 📚 Although he wasn't busy, he made an alibi for not watching her live streams. 
            In reality, he stayed logged in to ensure that no one would send bad words during her live sessions. 
            If she noticed his messages in the live chat, she would respond with a simple "Okay," unaware that he was actually staying to monitor the stream. 👀
        </p>
        <p>
            He couldn't risk being rejected or ruining the distance they had maintained. 
            Still, he promised himself that once they graduated, he would find her and make her his, prioritizing their studies in the meantime. 💪
        </p>
        <p>
            He knew that there was always a chance they could meet unexpectedly in the future. Whether it was during an event or just by fate, the boy dreamed that one day it would happen, that their virtual bond could become real. 🌠
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, the boy focused on his studies, spending his free time reading books 📖 or coding programs 💻. But no matter how much he tried to concentrate, he couldn’t unsee her smile 😊 or unhear her voice. Her image stayed in the back of his mind, always lingering, always present. 
            He knew that while they were apart, he could use these memories as inspiration, fueling his drive to succeed, not only for himself but for the hope that one day, their paths would cross again. ✨
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, their connection was a beautiful blend of friendship and unspoken feelings, a bond built in the virtual world, waiting for the right moment to flourish in reality. 🌸
